## MEMBERS standard/premium
The pixbux project has a multi-language public website where the user earns a reward for seeing a certain link on a website that is advertised within the platform or for fulfilling a certain function within their user panel. The user can have their account created for free, with account update options, thereby gaining priority in withdrawals and other user options, in addition to boosting the minimum time needed to view each and every link that pixbux advertises.

## Advertisers
The advertiser can choose different types of packages or group of members, this certainly has an impact on the results sought at the time of the advertisement, premium users, by having their account updated, have a much greater chance of adhering to the idea shown on the advertiser's website than a standard user. , in addition, the advertiser can put their ad in the spotlight, drawing more attention to the user who is viewing their link.

In addition to advertising links that are quoted by visits received (visits from registered users, invited visitors without a valid registration will not be counted, this is very important to inform here) the advertiser can advertise banners throughout the site, counted by active days.

More options will soon be announced here so that the advertiser has more options to get results from their advertisement.
